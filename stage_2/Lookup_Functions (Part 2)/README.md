# Lookup Functions (Part 2)

This lesson expands on lookup functions by introducing more flexible and modern alternatives. You will learn to use INDEX + MATCH, XLOOKUP, CHOOSE, and OFFSET to perform two-way lookups and create dynamic referencing systems.  

## Topics Covered  
- INDEX + MATCH combination for flexible lookups  
- Two-way lookups (row and column matches)  
- XLOOKUP for simpler, modern lookups  
- CHOOSE and OFFSET for dynamic referencing  
- Handling lookup errors gracefully  

## Practice File  
- [Lookup Functions (Part 2)](./Lookup_functions%20(Part%202).xlsx) → Dataset with employee performance records, dynamic lookup tools, and dashboard-based lookups  

## Key Takeaways  
- **INDEX + MATCH** allows looking left or right of the lookup column  
- **XLOOKUP** is more readable and allows custom “Not Found” messages  
- **CHOOSE** creates virtual tables from non-adjacent ranges  
- **OFFSET** helps create dynamic formulas but may slow large workbooks  
- Prefer **INDEX + MATCH** or **XLOOKUP** over **VLOOKUP** for flexibility and stability
