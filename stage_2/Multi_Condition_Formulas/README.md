# Multi-Condition Formulas  

This lesson focuses on using formulas that evaluate multiple conditions in Excel to perform detailed analysis. You will learn how to calculate sums, counts, and averages across several criteria and handle formula errors for cleaner reports.  

## Topics Covered  
- Applying multiple criteria with **SUMIFS**, **COUNTIFS**, and **AVERAGEIFS**  
- Using conditions across different columns  
- Handling formula errors with **IFERROR** and **IFNA**  
- Creating conditional sales summaries  

## Practice File  
- [Multi-Condition Formulas](./Multi_Condition_Formulas.xlsx) â†’ Sales dataset showing regional performance, product categories, and revenue summaries built with SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, and AVERAGEIFS formulas  

## Key Takeaways  
- **SUMIFS** adds values that meet multiple criteria  
- **COUNTIFS** counts records that satisfy several conditions  
- **AVERAGEIFS** calculates the average across filtered data  
- **IFERROR** and **IFNA** make results cleaner by preventing error messages  
- Multi-condition formulas are ideal for reports, summaries, and dashboards that rely on criteria-based analysis
