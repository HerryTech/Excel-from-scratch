# Conditional Logic Essentials  

This lesson introduces logical formulas that help Excel make decisions automatically. By combining functions like IF, IFS, AND, OR, and NOT, you can classify data, control outputs, and automate analysis results.  

## Topics Covered  
- Writing conditional logic with **IF** and **IFS**  
- Using **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** for multiple conditions  
- Nesting formulas to evaluate complex logic  
- Handling errors gracefully with **IFERROR**  
- Applying conditions to categorize or qualify data  

## Practice Files  
- [Conditional Logic Essentials](./Conditional_logic_essentials.xlsx) â†’ Dataset with student scores, averages, grades, and eligibility logic  

## Key Takeaways  
- **IF** tests a condition and returns one of two outcomes.  
- **IFS** replaces multiple IFs for cleaner formulas.  
- **AND** and **OR** help test more than one condition at once.  
- **IFERROR** improves readability by hiding formula errors.  
- Logical formulas are useful for grading, performance reviews, and data classification.
