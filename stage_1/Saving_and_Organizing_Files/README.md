# Saving and Organizing Files

This section focuses on file management skills necessary for effective data analysis. The emphasis is on understanding Excel file formats, proper saving practices, and creating a structured folder system for project organization.

## Topics Covered
- Common Excel file formats:
  - **.xlsx** – Standard format supporting formulas, charts, and formatting  
  - **.csv** – Plain text format storing only raw data without formatting or formulas  
  - **.xls** – Legacy Excel format with limited features (mentioned for reference)  
- Saving workbooks in multiple formats for different use cases   

## Practice Files
- **Day2_Practice.xlsx** – Example workbook saved in standard format with formatting and formulas.  
- **Day2_Practice.csv** – Equivalent dataset exported as raw data for comparison.  

## Key Takeaways
- Use `.xlsx` when working within Excel and `.csv` when exporting clean data for use in other tools (e.g., SQL, Python).  
- Formatting and formulas do not transfer when converting to `.csv`.
