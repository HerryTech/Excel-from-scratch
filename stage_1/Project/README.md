# Stage 1 Project – Sales Performance Dashboard

This project demonstrates practical application of Excel’s beginner-level data analysis and visualization tools. Using the **Sample Sales Data** from Kaggle, the goal was to create an interactive **Sales Performance Dashboard** that summarizes key business metrics, tracks sales trends, and enables dynamic insights through filters and visuals.

## Dataset
**Source:** [Sample Sales Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data)  
The dataset includes transactional records with details such as:
- Order Date  
- Customer Name  
- Product Line  
- Deal Size  
- Territory  
- Quantity Ordered  
- Price and Sales Revenue  
- Order Status  

## Objectives
- Analyze sales performance by **Product Line**, **Territory**, and **Deal Size**  
- Track **Total Sales**, **Orders**, and **Quantities** across years  
- Identify top-performing customers and best-selling product lines  
- Create an **interactive dashboard** for decision-makers to explore data easily  

## Skills and Concepts Learned
At this beginner stage, I practiced and applied the following Excel concepts:

- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Working with tables and named ranges  
- Using Excel formulas (e.g., `IF`, `LEFT`, `SUBSTITUTE`)  
- Creating Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts  
- Applying filters, slicers, and timelines for interactivity  
- Basic dashboard design and layout formatting  

### 6. Protection and Sharing
- Protected worksheets to prevent accidental edits  
- Hid helper sheets and intermediate calculations  
- Exported final dashboard to PDF and Excel for presentation  

## Dashboard Highlights
- **Total Sales:** $8.3M  
- **Total Orders:** 307  
- **Quantity Ordered:** 99,067  
- **Products Sold:** 2,823  
- Visual filters (Product Line, Territory, Deal Size, Year) enable focused insights  
- Clean, professional layout designed for management reporting  

## Key Takeaways
- PivotTables and slicers transform static data into dynamic, interactive insights  
- Proper formatting and protection enhance usability and presentation  
- Dashboards make complex datasets easier to interpret at a glance  
- Beginner Excel tools can create meaningful business intelligence solutions
