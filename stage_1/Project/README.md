# Stage 1 Project – Sales Performance Dashboard

This project demonstrates practical application of Excel’s beginner-level data analysis and visualization tools. Using the **Sample Sales Data** from Kaggle, the goal was to create an interactive **Sales Performance Dashboard** that summarizes key business metrics, tracks sales trends, and enables dynamic insights through filters and visuals.

## Dataset

- Order Date  
- Customer Name  
- Product Line  
- Deal Size  
- Territory  
- Quantity Ordered  
- Price and Sales Revenue  
- Order Status  

## Objectives
- Analyze sales performance by **Product Line**, **Territory**, and **Deal Size**  
- Track **Total Sales**, **Orders**, and **Quantities** across years  
- Identify top-performing customers and best-selling product lines  
- Create an **interactive dashboard** for decision-makers to explore data easily  

## Features Demonstrated
### 1. Data Preparation and Cleaning
- Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis
- Converted it to a table

### 2. Formulas and Calculations
- Used `IF`, `SUBSTITUTE`, `LEFT`, `TEXT` 
- Created calculated fields in PivotTables
- Used Data Model in pivot table to get distinct count and measures

### 3. PivotTables and PivotCharts
- Built PivotTables to summarize sales by **Year**, **Product Line**, **Region**, and **Deal Size**  
- Used grouping to analyze performance by month and quarter  
- Applied **Show Values As** for percentage and ranking analysis  

### 4. Interactive Controls
- Added **Slicers** for Product Line, Territory, and Deal Size  
- Added a **Timeline** filter for Year-based analysis  
- Enabled dynamic data exploration without changing the raw data  

### 5. Visualization
- Combined charts (Line, Column, and Pie) to display key metrics  
- Highlighted:
  - Sales Over Time  
  - Sales by Product Line  
  - Top 10 Customers  
  - Order Status Distribution  
  - Sales by Territory and Deal Size  
- Applied custom themes, color fills, and consistent borders for clarity  

### 6. Protection and Sharing
- Protected worksheets to prevent accidental edits  
- Hid helper sheets and intermediate calculations  
- Exported final dashboard to PDF and Excel for presentation  

## Dashboard Highlights
- **Total Sales:** $8.3M  
- **Total Orders:** 307  
- **Quantity Ordered:** 99,067  
- **Products Sold:** 2,823  
- Visual filters (Product Line, Territory, Deal Size, Year) enable focused insights  
- Clean, professional layout designed for management reporting  

## Key Takeaways
