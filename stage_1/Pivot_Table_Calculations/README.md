# PivotTable Calculations & Slicer

This lesson builds on the basics of PivotTables by showing how to perform calculations directly inside the PivotTable. Instead of writing formulas in worksheet cells, you can summarize values in different ways, display them as percentages or rankings, and even create custom calculated fields. It also builds on how to use **Slicers** and **Timelines** for interactive filtering.

## Topics Covered
- Summarizing values using different functions (`SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`)  
- Showing values as percentages, differences, or rankings  
- Creating **Calculated Fields** (e.g., Bonus = Sales × 0.05)
- Adding **Slicers** to filter PivotTables by fields like Department or Employee  
- Adding **Timelines** to filter PivotTables by Date fields (Month, Quarter, Year)  


## Practice Files
- [PivotTable Calculations](./Pivot_table_calculations.xlsx) → Dataset with employee names, departments, salaries, sales, and dates  

## Key Takeaways
- PivotTables do not stop at sums; you can quickly switch to averages, counts, maximums, or minimums for deeper insights.  
- The **Show Values As** option lets you analyze data in new ways, such as percentages of totals, differences from a base, or rankings.  
- **Calculated Fields** let you add your own formulas inside a PivotTable, making them powerful tools for analysis without leaving the PivotTable environment.
