# PivotTable Basics

This lesson introduces PivotTable, one of Excel’s most powerful tools for summarizing and analyzing data. PivotTable allow you to quickly group, filter, and calculate values without changing the original dataset. You will learn how to create PivotTables, organize data into rows and columns, and apply basic calculations.

## Topics Covered
- Creating a PivotTable from a dataset with dates, salaries, and departments  
- Placing fields in **Rows**, **Columns**, **Values**, and **Filters**  
- Summarizing data with functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, and `AVERAGE`  
- Grouping by **Date** (Year, Quarter, Month), **Numbers** (e.g., salary bands), **Text** (custom categories)
- Filtering and sorting within a PivotTable

## Key Takeaways
- PivotTable helps you analyze large datasets without writing complex formulas.  
- Fields can be dragged into **Rows**, **Columns**, **Values**, and **Filters** to create different perspectives of the data.  
- You can group date fields into years, quarters, or months for time-based analysis, spot patterns by grouping numbers into ranges, and organize text into custom categories. 
- PivotTable can be refreshed when the source data changes, making them dynamic and reliable for reporting.
