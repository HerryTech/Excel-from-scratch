# Sorting and Filtering  

This section introduces Excel’s sorting and filtering tools, which allow you to organize and analyze datasets efficiently. Sorting arranges rows in a logical order, while filtering helps you focus only on relevant information. Together, these skills are essential for managing and exploring large datasets.  

## Topics Covered  
- Sorting by a single column (e.g., price from lowest to highest)  
- Multi-level sorting (e.g., category A–Z, then total Z–A)  
- Applying text filters (e.g., products starting with “S”)  
- Applying number filters (e.g., prices greater than ₦500)  
- Combining multiple filter conditions across columns  

## Practice Files  
- [Sorting_filtering](./Sorting_filtering.xlsx) — dataset with products, categories, prices, quantities, and totals for practicing sorting and filtering  

## Key Takeaways  
- Sorting organizes data in a meaningful order, making trends easier to spot  
- Filtering hides irrelevant rows, allowing focus on specific conditions  
- Text and number filters enable precise control over displayed data  
- Multiple filters can be combined across columns for advanced analysis  
- Sorting and filtering together form the basis for effective data exploration
