# Conditional Formatting

This lesson introduces Conditional Formatting in Excel, a tool that automatically changes the appearance of cells based on the values they contain. You will learn how to apply rules, use color scales, and add icons to make data patterns easier to see and interpret.

## Topics Covered
- Highlighting cells based on conditions  
- Using **Icon Sets** to categorize values (e.g., salaries: green = high, yellow = medium, red = low)  
- Applying **Data Bars** to compare values visually  
- Using **Color Scales** to show ranges with gradients  
- Customizing rules and thresholds in the **Manage Rules** panel  

## Practice Files
- [Conditional Formatting](./Conditional_formatting.xlsx) â†’ Employee dataset with 30+ columns for practice  

## Key Takeaways
- Conditional Formatting makes large datasets easier to analyze visually.  
- Rules can highlight values that meet specific criteria (e.g., more than 5 years of experience).  
- Icon Sets, Data Bars, and Color Scales turn raw numbers into clear visuals.  
- Customizing thresholds ensures formatting is meaningful and accurate for your dataset.
