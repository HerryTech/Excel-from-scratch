# Data Validation and Drop-down Lists

This section introduces Data Validation, a feature in Excel that helps control the type of data entered into a cell. By setting rules and restrictions, you ensure cleaner datasets, reduce errors, and improve data consistency. Drop-down lists make data entry even faster and more reliable by limiting inputs to predefined options.

## Topics Covered
- Applying **Data Validation** rules for:
  - Whole numbers (e.g., only numbers between 100,000 and 500,000)
  - Decimals (e.g., only numbers between 0.1 and 1.0)
  - Dates (e.g., only dates between 01/01/2015 and 12/31/2025)
  - Lists (restrict entries to specific options, e.g., HR, IT, Sales, Finance)
  - Custom formulas (e.g., `=ISNUMBER(A2)` to allow only numbers)
- Creating **Drop-down Lists** for quick and controlled data entry
  - Defining list items manually (comma-separated)
  - Using a cell range as the source (e.g., `=$F$2:$F$5`)
- Customizing **Error Alerts** with user-friendly messages (e.g., “Salary must be between ₦100,000 and ₦500,000.”)

## Key Takeaways
- Data Validation ensures that only correct and relevant values are entered in a cell  
- Drop-down lists standardize data entry and reduce mistakes  
- Validation rules can be applied to numbers, dates, lists, or even custom formulas  
- Error alerts guide users with helpful messages when invalid data is entered  
- Clean and validated datasets are easier to analyze and maintain
