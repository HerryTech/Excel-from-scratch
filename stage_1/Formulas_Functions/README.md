# Formulas and Functions

This lesson introduces formulas and basic functions in Excel, enabling dynamic calculations that update automatically when data changes. You will learn how to create formulas, understand cell references, and apply common functions for quick analysis.

## Topics Covered
- Writing formulas with cell references  
- Relative vs. absolute references (`C2*D2` vs. `$C$2*$D$2`)  
- Common functions:  
  - `SUM` (total values)  
  - `AVERAGE` (mean value)  
  - `MIN` (lowest value)  
  - `MAX` (highest value)  

## Practice Files

## Key Takeaways
- Formulas allow Excel to perform calculations that update dynamically.  
- Cell references can be **relative** (change when copied) or **absolute** (fixed with `$`).  
- Functions like `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `MIN`, and `MAX` provide quick insights into data.  
- Using formulas reduces manual errors and improves efficiency in analysis.
