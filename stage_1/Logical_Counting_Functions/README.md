# Logical & Counting Functions 
This section introduces Excel’s logical and counting functions, which allow you to analyze datasets by testing conditions and summarizing values. Logical functions like `IF` help classify data based on rules, while counting functions such as `COUNT`, `COUNTA`, and `COUNTIF` make it easy to quantify entries that meet specific criteria.

## Topics Covered  
- **IF Function** — Apply logical tests to categorize or label data.  
- **COUNT vs COUNTA** — Count numbers only vs. all non-empty cells.  
- **COUNTIF** — Count based on a specific condition (text or number).

## Key Takeaways  
- `IF` is useful for labeling or categorizing data using conditions.  
- `COUNT` counts only numbers, while `COUNTA` counts all filled cells (text and number).  
- `COUNTIF` quickly calculates how many cells meet a given condition.  
- These functions add **analytical power** and help extract insights from raw data.
