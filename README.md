# Excel From Scratch

This repository documents my journey of re-learning Microsoft Excel from the very beginning to advanced level. I want to start over, build consistency, and track my daily progress here on GitHub. It is structured in **three stages**, each building on the previous one through hands-on lessons, practical exercises, and real-world projects. The goal is to master Excel for data analysis, business reporting, and decision-making.  

## Learning Path  

### Stage 1 - Excel Fundamentals  
Focuses on mastering the basics of Excel. This includes navigating the interface, entering and formatting data, using simple formulas, managing worksheets, and creating basic charts and PivotTables. The stage ends with a **Sales Performance Dashboard** project that applies all beginner concepts.

Expands on core skills by introducing advanced formulas, data cleaning tools, lookup functions, and automation techniques. It also covers advanced charting, conditional analysis, Power Query, and error handling.
